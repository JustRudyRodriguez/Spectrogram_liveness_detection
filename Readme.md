This repo contains my work on a liveness detection system using Spectrogram images and machine learning.

The Folder "Lexa Project-Sans Dataset" contains most of the project files used. The data set is not included due to size limitations. 
https://github.com/YuanGongND/ReMASC - The dataset used is available here.

The video link is a quick demonstration of real world testing cases. All of the work done was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result a proper lab was not available during filming. Test equipment was also limited. 

Finally there is a PDF file included, that ellaborates on the value and extent of my work.
