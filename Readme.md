This repo contains my work on a liveness detection system using Spectrogram images and machine learning.

"The Main goal of the project was the paper that was written studying the results of the work in this repo.

The paper was published in 2022 https://worldaiiotcongress.org/
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174522
I recieved best presenter for my group in the conference. 

As the main work was in the paper, the repo is somewhat of a mess.aa" - 10/1/2022

The Folder "Lexa Project-Sans Dataset" contains most of the project files used. The data set is not included due to size limitations. 
https://github.com/YuanGongND/ReMASC - The dataset used is available here.

The video link is a quick demonstration of real world testing cases. All of the work done was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result a proper lab was not available during filming. Test equipment was also limited. 

Finally there is a PDF file included, that ellaborates on the value and extent of my work.
